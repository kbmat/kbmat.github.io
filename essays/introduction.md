Aloha! My name is Kimberly Matutina and I was born and raised on the island of Kauai. My grandparents and parents migrated to Hawaii from the Philippines, so they were not very tech-savvy and had trouble with English. Due to this, my older brother and I had to learn how to do things at an early age such as filling out government documents, fixing the Wi-Fi and the computers, and much more. Thus I have become very accustomed to learning how to do things on my own, especially with technology.

During high school and when I was first admitted to the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I took a path directed towards hospitality. After my first year of college, I realized that I was not passionate about working within the hospitality and tourism industry. However, I had always been fascinated by technology and computers.

Finally, I currently work at the Information Technology Center at UH Manoa within the Telecom department. I have thoroughly enjoyed my job where I have to resolve technical issues that come about. I am very passionate about working hands on with technology. Thus, I am very excited to be starting my journey as an MIS major.
