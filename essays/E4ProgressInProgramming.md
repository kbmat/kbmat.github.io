My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
Prior to starting this class, the only "programming" skills I had was that I knew how to use terminal and the bare minimum about HTML and CSS. At this point in the semester, my programming skills have definitely improved. 

For one, in the beginning, I was very set on simply copying what Professor Port did during the lab lectures, but I have learned to not simply copy and get myself to fully understand the concept of how everything works.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
The biggest thing that I need to work on to improve my programming skills is practicing more about what I'm learning. A lot of the times when I

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.
Honestly, I would have to disagree with this statement. In the beginning when we were just working on HTML and CSS, I was able to do the WODs without having to look at the screencast solutions first, but once we got to learning about JavaScript, I needed the screencast solutions. Even though I need to refer back to the screencast solutions, I always read through what I am supposed to do and then try it on my own without recording. I usually do the WOD up until a point of the assignment where I am definitely unsure about what to do, then I refer to the screencast. As we moved on throughout the semester, I started needing help starting off the WOD, then I was able to do the rest (or most) of the WOD by myself.

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
Most of the labs have certainly helped me learn, but I am not able to complete them with confidence if we didn't work on them in class. While we're going through the labs, I am able to understand essentially how certain concepts work, but I still need help. Doing the labs in class help, but whenever we needed to complete a few exercises on our own, it took me a long time to figure those out. My only concern about labs is when we would need to prepare for the next lab before we even completed the current lab we were on. I understand that the class needs to be fast paced so we can learn everything that we need, but sometimes I feel as though it's more important to make sure we understand what we're currently learning and then we can decide if we're ready to move onto the next concept.

I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).
I do not feel ready at all to work on the next stage of complexity in programming. When reading the sources, watching the screencast lectures, and going through the lab in class, I feel as though I am thoroughly understanding what we're doing. However, when I had to work on assignment 1, I realized that I need to do more in understanding the how everything works. With assignment 1, I wasn't sure how to bring everything that I learned from reading, screencasts, labs, and WODS together to create a website.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
One of the things that I think can be improved is something that would have helped in the beginning of the semester. I have mentioned it above, but I think it would have been a lot better for me to focus on one concept rather than moving on to the next when we haven't even finished that yet. 
Another thing that I personally think could be improved, but I understand is not how this particular class can work, is I enjoy having set dates of everything prior to it being due so that I can plan everything out. However, I do know that a lot of the time we don't know how long it would take us to get through certain labs which is understandable.

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:
The screencasts for each of the concepts we have learned about definitely helped me in understanding the basics of what we would be doing for that day. With the screencasts, I am also able to pause and make sure that I am really understanding what I'm learning about and I have time to practice it myself.

Another thing that works really well for my learning in this class is Professor Port's office hours. I didn't really reach out to Professor Port too often before assignment 1, maybe twice because I didn't really have any questions or know what to ask. However, I needed a lot of help with assignment 1 and being able to schedule a time with him helped me tremendously in working on assignment 2.
