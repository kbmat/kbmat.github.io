Overview
The last Workout of the Day (WOD) I completed was Invoice 1. I had to create a sales receipt that contained at least five different products. Then, I had to use expressions and variables to compute the needed values dynamically. For my product items, I chose skin care products and chose to use the same prices and quantities as the example. For more details, please go to the following link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html.

Experiences
Compared to the first few WODs, I definitely had to prepare a lot more for Invoice 1. The first few WODs weren't too bad because I had already had prior knowledge on how to use HTML and CSS. For Invoice 1, this was my first on-my-own practice writing in JavaScript. For the most part, completing Lab 6 prior to finishing this WOD definitely helped me to understand and know how to use JavaScript. One of the parts that took me longer to figure out was generating the product rows. I got a little confused as to where to start my script and I had to learn how I was supposed to use a ` backtick after using document.write. Another part that I had to figure out was how to keep the format to 2 decimals for my tax and total. Other than those parts, this WOD was relatively easy, just a little time consuming.

Preparation
To prepare, I read through and took notes on the readings that was required. While reading and taking notes, I also practiced writing code in my own console a little so that I knew that I would be able to do it by myself. For the past few WODs I didn't need to watch the entirety of the screencasts, but being that this was my first time practicing JavaScript for a WOD, I had to watch the entire screencast to be sure I knew how to complete the WOD. One way that I prepared differently from the past WODs is that while watching the screencast, I paused the video where I didn't know what to do and once I got past it, I continued the WOD on my own until I needed help again.

Reflection for the Future
Sometimes it feels as though these WODs are very time consuming, but everytime I finish them and finally figure out parts where I was stuck, it definitely makes me feel great. Doing these WODs easily stress me out, but the sense of relief after completing them makes it worth it. In order to better prepare for future WODs, I think that I should spend more time practicing code in my browser console instead of typing out notes as I would for a regular class. My older brother, who has his degree in engineering from UH Manoa, visited from Oahu recently and saw the way I took my notes. He basically told me I was learning wrong and that I should  practice writing the code so that I understand how it works rather than trying to "study" coding.
